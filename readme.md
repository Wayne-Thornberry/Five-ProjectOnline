# Project Online
Project Online is a massive FiveM project written primarly in C# that sets out to achive 2 goals. Concepted in 2019, the intital aim was to recreate
GTA:Online and its resources into the FiveM experiance so that people could easily spin up their own Classic GTA:Online server, expand to create
their own version of GTA:Online or improve GTA:Online in the modern way.

Overtime, the project expanded into the two goals now. The resource framework and the classic experiance.

## Resource Framework
The resource framework aims to streamline the process of creating new FiveM scripted resources. 

## Classic Experiance
The resources packed will provide you with the default resources that will set you up with a Server that is very close to GTA:Online as it was in 2013.
Including new and improved APIs that can be called via exports and a configurable and expandable data set to allow you to fine tune the GTA:Online experiance 
even in vanilla. Use this as a baseline for if you want to expand your version of Online further.

## Q&A
### How do i use Project Online?
If you wish to use the resources of Project Online, just download the latest release and unpack into your FiveM server directory. If you wish
to instead develop using the resource framework, extract the Proline.Resource folder and reference it in your realitive Client & Server project.

### Can i contrabute?
Yes, Project Online is open to forks to help create resources that emulate the GTA:Online setting. If you wish to instead improve the Framework, you can also
contrabute to that.
